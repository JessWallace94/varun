Hi!

I've been an entrepreneur since I was 19. Did some fun experimentation with building my agency and then a product, that graduated out of YC Startup School 2019 batch. I also wrote a book along the way. Currently helping build Vymo with growth and product marketing.

I've got a deep passion for B2B Enterprise software in the deskless workforce space. I'm also currently self-teaching myself on how to become a product manager.
