Hi, I’m Varun. I currently work with [Vymo](https://getvymo.com/) helping them with growth/product marketing. 

In the past, I started from freelancing as a content writer on [Fiverr.com](http://fiverr.com) to building my own content marketing agency WiseWords Interactive Studio Private Limited. 

I wrote a book called 'Miracle-preneuring: why anyone can and should be an entrepreneur' which is a self-help book about entrepreneurship. Ideal for first-timers. [Here are the 3 book trailers I made](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW4BHOGauqa0cXLJ278brkg]). (first time I ever made any videos; don’t judge). 

You can buy it on [Amazon/Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-preneuring-Why-anyone-should-entrepreneur/dp/153530605X), [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/miracle-preneuring/id1137891452), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/miracle-preneuring-varun-choraria/1124138361), [Google Books](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Miracle_Preneuring.html?id=KuTyvQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y) and [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/miracle-preneuring/p/itmfcy3xgjphemfk).

And I also built my first no-code side project [Aibo: Learn the basics of MBA in less than a day via Facebook Messenger](https://getaibo.launchaco.com/). Trending at #4 on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/aibo-2), and #1 on [BetaList](https://betalist.com/@miraclepreneur), we hit 850+ users purely on WoM. We're also a graduate of [Y Combinator's Startup School 2019 batch](https://www.startupschool.org/companies/kkZY2Tl71-CkuQ). Read my tell-all of how I built it [here](https://medium.com/the-ascent/no-code-no-domain-my-tell-all-of-building-my-first-product-and-making-it-to-4-on-product-hunt-42ebcabd45db).

I spend my time reading, writing and working to becoming less wrong every day.
