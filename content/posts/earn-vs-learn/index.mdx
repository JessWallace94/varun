I think at some point in our lives- be it between a job transition or figuring out the next phase of personal/startup growth- we all fall into the dark abyss of imposter syndrome and utter confusion. 

And that’s okay. 

I’m currently in a similar phase myself. I remember [reading this essay by Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) that he wrote after his 30th - reflecting on 30 important lessons that he’d picked up along the way. 

I turned 23 yesterday, on 19th January 2020. I feel old now, haha! One thought from that essay stuck out pretty well to me:

> “The days are long but the decades are short”

2000 was 20 years ago. 2010 was 10 years ago. Heck, I joined engineering in 2015- which was 5 years ago. Decades and time in general, do fly by. But then every day still seems pretty long to me- I have 24 hours a day out of which I work for 12 at least, excluding commute. 

I have big plans for this decade- big things are sure to happen, both career-wise and personally. And I feel I owe it to myself a good plan and direction in place. 

Direction really is important than speed, a crucial lesson I picked up while starting up and writing a book while I was still at college. 

Now that I am working a job and have ‘concrete’ financial and personal goals in place- planning for the rest of this decade, or for this year alone- isn’t that easy. Believe me. 

And hence, I now face this question- “Is it time for me to earn, or learn, or do both?”

A lot of people confusing learning with earning. Myself included. 

It’s not always possible to make your retirement money off the job you work- that could actually be your learning phase. No-brainer, right?

## The learning perspective

In my short experience, I’ve observed that it’s important to have realistic expectations with the company you will be/ are working for. 

Make sure whatever you get out of the stint is one, or several of the following: a great network of senior managers and other talented executives; more responsibility than your last job; specific industry skills that will help you do what’s next; a chance to partner with industry peers to help you maybe startup in the future; etc. 

Tieing these high-level objectives to your current scenario- I’d say this:

Join a company or get associated with a partner because of the long-term mission they have in mind. Individual contributions compound over time and help you earn the stripes needed to call the shots later on. 

Join because you think you can do a really good job at whatever you’re being hired for-as when you graduate to a senior or mid-senior position, you’ll be able to perform much better than your peers. 

If you ever feel that in the year ahead of you- you won’t be doing anything that could add value to your resume, then quit. No two ways about it. A year is simply too much to waste in figuring anything out. 

Don’t join for the options. It’s just the icing on the cake. Join maybe because they pay well. 

Sidenote: If you’re between 20 and 25 like me, you can focus on either learning or earning. But know why you’re doing either. Have short-term and long-term clarity on what you want to get out of this. 

For example- before I turned 22, I had already consulted with 3 companies, started up twice, wrote a book and build a product. And then I figured I needed to gain more corporate exposure and earn at the same time, which is why I decided to take up a job that could help me polish my hard and soft skills. Building experience on my resume like that really paid off. Both in terms of my deliverability at work and personal leverage in general. 

Additionally, you can also check out [this piece I wrote on Medium](https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-you-will-most-definitely-fail-in-life-and-the-secret-code-to-save-yourself-6b6456e3a865) sometime back that talks about the importance of educating yourself without being dependent on college or degrees. 

## Sometimes, the focus is bad

When you’re learning, another question you’ll be bound to come across is whether to optimize or to innovate. Do I upskill and then innovate in whatever I’m doing right now? Or do I optimize my learnings to the expected outcomes of my current role and create a long-standing monopoly for myself? 

I read [where good ideas come](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380) from a long while ago and came across the idea of ‘the adjacent possible.’ The TL;DR of this is that the specifics of great ideas and technology are an iterative process and macro things develop over time. 

For example- the iPhone or the computers we have wasn’t invented in a day. It went through an iterative process of devising semiconductors, transistors, microprocessors, displays, and whatnot. It took almost 5 decades. 

The core idea of the ‘adjacent possible’ in my opinion is to find a balance between verticalizing and expanding. 

*Verticalizing = slower= small payoffs (subjective)= minimal risk= practical and obvious* 
*Expanding = faster= big payouts=big risk= practical (subjective) and not-so-obvious* 

Let me give you an example- Amazon first started selling books online and it was much easier for them to launch an ebook platform and adjacent offerings to become more reliable. 

So, find the best adjacent thing that you can do with your current frame of reference/situation. 

And then there’s just concept of ‘too much too soon’ which basically fucked me up during the early days of starting up/engineering. 

Sidenote: This is a [good case study](https://www.businessinsider.in/All-the-businesses-under-The-We-Company-the-47-billion-WeWork-owner-that-could-reveal-its-IPO-paperwork-any-day-now/WeGrow-To-unleash-every-humans-superpowers-/slideshow/70663518.cms) to see what ‘too much too soon’ looks like in action. 

The broad idea of this notion is that things can be either a great learning curve or a waste of time. It can be a worthwhile investment or an expensive distraction. The big wins do come from big moves and big risks. So if you ask me, I think there’s a real winner with trying newer things within your horizon rather than just tweaking. 

## The earning perspective

When you start this journey, you must have complete clarity on your skills, background, and ideas. You can only earn big if you’re in the top 3% of the company. Get in the driver’s seat, and quit dicking around basically. 

At this point, you must have put some serious thought into matching your current economic situation, talent, age, skills, and overall ambition with your current reality. Be realistic about outcomes, but not focus on it so much. The trench-work era is over. 

But then, how much money do you really need to make for you to be ‘rich’?

I read this [article on Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-05-23/bankers-don-t-think-you-re-rich-unless-you-have-25-million?__twitter_impression=true) and found some interesting points worth mentioning:

1. According to bankers, $25M is just investable wealth. It means if you’ve got that money chances are some bankers will notice you. You’re starting to be rich here. I like the term mentioned in the article ‘economy-class rich’ to describe this amount of wealth. Lol. 

2. [The wealth gap](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-14/credit-suisse-sees-reversal-of-fortunes-in-wealth-creation) between broke-ass poor, rich and really fucking rich is only getting wider in this age of hyper-wealth and hyper-inequality. 

##  What do you do at the crossroads then?

I’ve grown up in a largely polar upbringing where everything is binary. You either win or you lose; you either earn or you learn. And my experiences thus far have only said that both can and should go hand-in-hand. 

One simply cannot co-exist without the other. 

What I’ve realized is that it’s not the effort but the systems you build over time that matter to reduce the overall margin of error. 

Whether you’re on the learning side or the earning, you need to continually optimize it to build a better personal system that works both for yourself and your career. 

One of the core areas of system-making is to get constant peer feedback and build resilience, and then quality will follow. 

Here’s a personal example: my commute to work is incredibly long and painful. Public transport is a better option for me- since I can read, spend time with people, daydream and also listen to podcasts, etc. The value is in place but at the cost of my personal well-being. 

Initially, I decided to save costs and travel by bus across the city- but that didn’t work out despite me optimizing all routes and figuring out where to hop on so I get a seat. For a while this system worked- my spendings were minimal and I got more time to myself. But over a month, the fatigue started to kick in. 

I then decided to pool via Uber and Ola- and while the cost of travel increased, my body didn’t get so tired anymore. I saved on both time and energy, at a slight increase in cost. Result? I’m less stressed and tired every day now. I can focus on other things. 

I mean, I could have opted for a more careful outlook- eating right, sleeping more, etc. Apparently hectic work life doesn’t let you stay very consistent with these things, as I’ve observed. 

But in this simple case scenario, I chose to build a better system for myself that would help me accomplish my learning and earning goals (earning potential is proportional to the mental state of stress, overall health etc.)
