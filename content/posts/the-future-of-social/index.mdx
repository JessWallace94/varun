For a while now, I've been pondering about what the future of social media and communities will look like. What will the next WhatsApp, Instagram or even LinkedIn look like?

First, let's understand the purpose of having social media/communities in the first place. In my opinion, I think the top two use cases for a social platform would be to serve as a utility tool and to encourage conversations.

In fact, I think the most intellectual conversations happening on the internet right now are happening in:

1. Telegram (invite-only groups)
2. WhatsApp (invite-only groups)
3. Slack (invite-only groups)
4. Discord servers (again, invite-only)
I guess it's time to say we're inching towards an invite-only internet?

Plus, I think these invite-only groups only hold good if they are limited to 20-50 people. Once it crosses that I think trust challenges will start to surface, along with the dilution of the signal-to-noise ratio. Around the time when it pretty much goes to shit.

Here's an interesting product I came across that has verticalized and redesigned WhatsApp, Instagram and alike combined into a single app.

It's called [Cocoon](https://cocoon.com/) and they claim to be a dedicated 'space' for the most important people in your life. And this one [use case](https://twitter.com/Cocoon_HQ/status/1215325820496990209) stood out to me the most and reinforced their mission statement as well.

*(also, this is no promotion. I don't know anybody from Cocoon, I swear).*x

Essentially, [the tweet shows a GIF](https://twitter.com/SachinMonga/status/1215340331232706560?s=20) wherein you can track your loved ones within the family's space on the app if they are on a flight or something. I mean think about it- we're always going to be concerned about our loved ones, especially when they travel. Normally, we WhatsApp/iMessage flight tickets, constantly update statuses/ travel logs, etc- which can be quite irritating especially if there's a tight itinerary in place or well, the person just needs some alone time during the travel.

This was also arguably the coolest part of the tweet:

I was able to relate to this because an old girlfriend once went abroad and I found it hard to communicate and check on her as often as I'd like. I remember juggling between WhatsApp-ing her and checking her flight status on Google.

Alternatively, in our daily lives too- we've probably asked our loved ones to share their live location with us via WhatsApp or added them to our Google maps so we know where they are all the time (for safety concerns, obviously- unless your partner is cheating on you, then I suggest you abandon all social media and sort that shit).

If Cocoon existed back then, this feature would've been God-given.

### So, why did Cocoon catch my attention so much?

I found [this report](https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/docs/IndexReport_1524069371598-173525450.pdf) on their [about us page](https://cocoon.com/about.html) and here are some noteworthy points:

1. When asked how often they feel like no one knows them well, more than half of the respondents (54%) surveyed said they feel that way always or sometimes.
2. At least two in five surveyed sometimes or always feel as though they lack companionship (43%), that their relationships are not meaningful (43%), that they are isolated from others (43%), and/or that they are no longer close to anyone (39%). 
3. Those who never have in-person interactions are also less likely to have “balance” in their lives, with only 36% saying they get the right amount of sleep (vs. 50% of those who have daily in-person interactions) and 37% saying they get the right amount of family time (vs. 65%). 

Now let's tie all of these factoids to real-life events.

1. The living room used to be the social media decades ago. So if you look at our parents, they mostly spent their entire lives in the same city/neighborhood. Their children, siblings, etc. lived within close proximity too. The concept of the nuclear family didn't exist.
2. Today, an average of 30% of people aged 18-24 years move to another city, and either live alone, with a partner or with transient roommates. Every aspect of life is now lived in transit. Your food, laundry, even your maids are all in transit and at your command, controlled by software.
3. There are two types of family- (1) blood-related family and (2) chosen family. In either use case, the broad assumption (read: constraint) is that we want to remain close-knit as that bond we share is sacred. Without checking on these people every day, we feel empty and alone.

Which now brings me to my next section- that Cocoon is essentially solving a human problem, not really a technology one. (heck- we've got super apps like GoJek, Swiggy is also walking the same path now and then there are WhatsApp groups more prominent than ever before).

**The dining table effect: solving the disconnect and social vs real-life balance problem (and how future social apps can make money)**

Social media today is just highlights and comments. It's vanity statuses that we can add filters and make our lives more liveable (psuedo-reality). It's all false happiness that's missing the whole point of online social communities- the feeling of being present even when you're not. Those mini-interactions that occur unexpectedly, or 'the dining table effect'.

Social apps aren't secluded from the real world. But with family and loved ones, you need privacy. You need a world away from the real world. But that's present on WhatsApp groups too right?- I mean, it's serving the purpose for millions of families across the globe. Then why are we debating here?

I believe that text-only groups are pretty one-dimensional- it's the same static shit for everyone. On a rather aspirational note- a verticalized private community must mimic real-life, like a virtual HQ. 1:1 interactions with family-chosen or blood-related will largely be digital in the future. The days of the physical dining table have gone.

So how can an app really solve the social disconnect problem?

Well, for starters- it should have seamless integrations between food-delivery, transport booking, and basic lifestyle apps-without a lot of difference in the UX. It needs to feel like you're with your loved ones- deciding what to eat or what to wear for a party.

Curation is pretty much the best thing that has happened to mankind thanks to the internet. We can curate our lives by choosing whom we meet in real life online for example. In a world where social media is dead thanks to adblockers, (because companies cannot track you as much right now and hence personalization of ads is lost, which means you won't buy from them), helping people curate their own virtual world is the way forward to make money off social media.

Imagine this- Your family is paying a monthly subscription (a lot like a Netflix or your carrier's family plan) to use this private, verticalized app. You add your interests, schedules, share likes and dislikes- basically go through an onboarding process that will let the app paint a virtual picture of who you are in real life.

Using AI, ML or some hi-tech shit, the app is now able to read all the member's data to find common interests- across content to watch online, what to read, what clothes to buy or what destinations to visit together. Connect your bank accounts too and fuck, the app would even suggest curated family + individual insurances buy from one-tap. An entire virtual economy is created on one app.

With additional features like pre-recording virtual hugs, hey's and hellos- anytime you miss your spouse or girlfriend- let the app know and the app will send this pre-recording to you :) (all without disturbing your partner's meeting or any crucial event).

A gamification layer on top of this that calculates how many times you have probably seen the pre-recordings or explored the other person's interest or picked out things for her to watch over the weekend maybe- will all be assigned a weight and then calculated into attributes like love, how much you've been thinking about that person- etc (in %) maybe.

Couple and family goals to achieve- ta-da! (aka getting people hooked on to the app, without cheap sales-y offers).

*You're actually helping people overcome the disconnect and the overwhelm of hectic work lives through a foundational, fully customizable private sanctuary that really brings people closer.*

For SaaS subscription companies, this is a great LTV at low CAC. And for you, it's a foundation to do more things together with your family.
