# Being busy is a trap. This 2020, aim to become productive and achieve more instead. 

Research says that 67% of people have experienced burnout. I experience one every week, thanks to the hectic lifestyle I live. That's the premise.

Now, on the aspirational front, here's what I want to achieve this year:

- I want to work constantly at peak performance
- I want to do more in the limited time that I have
- I want to align my core values and strengths to my goals, and then build systems over habits.

Sounds perfect, doesn’t it? But it’s not so in reality. 

Let's draw nuances from the beginning.

As humans, Maslow's hierarchy of needs should have sufficed. But there's another interesting trait about us- we like to be constantly busy. That's why Maslow's theory in today's context is just a cycle of constant disappointment and desperation. Our glass will never really be full.

I'd like to recall this dialogue from Mad Men, which further adds a dramatic touch to the statement above:

> “We're flawed because we want so much more. We're ruined because we get these things and wish for what we had.”

I bet this hit you right in the spot. It hit me too.

We're all prisoners of the illusion of productivity. Here's an interesting research to prove the thesis. I won't delve into the details here, so here is the finding, in the words of the scientists:

> “Our research suggests that many purported goals that people pursue may be merely justifications to keep themselves busy.”

There's a societal flaw that's made us busy zombies. It's that being idle (=not being busy) is considered as a sign of laziness. And in my opinion, we keep ourselves so busy all the time because we're too afraid to be inside our heads. When we're idle, we're alone. We're afraid of facing the truth, let alone acknowledging it.

But what I’ve realized in all of my working years so far is that being busy is not being productive. 

Back when I started my first company in college, I constantly kept myself “busy” and gave others (and myself) the illusion that I was onto building the next big unicorn. The flipside of this is that I became ignorant of:
- Falling in love with the process 
- Building real knowledge (I did champion all half-knowledge fuckups)
- Living life like a normal college guy (“Too much, too soon”)

Fuck, we fool ourselves a lot, don’t we? 

Another cherry on top is that we’re always distracted. Let’s all agree that we practice getting distracted every day for years, which is why we can’t sit at a place for hours and get real work done with full focus, for example. 

Even when we’re with a date or doing something else, we’re barely paying attention because our subconscious system has been corrupted by the virus of distraction. Consequently, we tend to cascade our tensions, stress, and frustration to relationships and family. 

And when we’re confronted, we just say ‘we’re too busy with work”.  

## Here’s what I recommend to get off the busyness hamster wheel, from my experience:

1. Bring a transformational change to your mindset: One of the things I picked up from my manager or my peers at work was that they never say they are busy. I always hear them saying ‘it’s not a priority’. And I think we need to adapt that in general, in our lives. We have limited time and energy every day- and there’s plenty of room in there to only do important things. Focus on that. You could probably try a 3-2-1 approach: 3 important tasks, 2 medium priority tasks, and 1 low-priority task. You don’t have to follow this exact framework, but you get the idea. **Pro tip: family/spouse is always a priority. But not all friends. You can also try out the Eisenhower matrix of prioritization by reading this.**

2. Focus on achieving more with less: Right now you’re probably thinking that you’ve got plenty of things on your plate, and they may all seem important. But from a bird’s eye view- you’ll find that 70% of the things are not. Why? They’re not aligned with your natural flow and core values. You’re just doing this as a false justification of doing more work = more success. 
Shift your focus on tasks to outcomes. Let’s say one of your goals is to apply for an MBA this year. I’d start by first identifying the overall process- syllabus, peer connect, mock tests, mock interviews, etc. Divide them into theme-based buckets like this and then create a task-list under each, assigning a priority value (P0- highest priority and mission-critical; P1: high priority but not critical; P2: Important but not critical; P3: Fuck it). Then it’s simple- use Google Calendar (or anydo- I use a combination of both myself) and block time on your calendar every day to accomplish tasks based on priority. At the end of the week, retrospect on what went right, what went wrong and build this system over time. You’ll be surprised by how much you can achieve. Without sacrificing partying or hanging out. 

3. Say NO and say it often: I can’t stress this enough. Be it at work or anything, do not accept everything that comes your way. Make sure whatever work or task you pick up- is in line with your core values and career goals. If you want to move to product and product management, but you’re from a different team- then research enough on the company/industry and study the basics of the product. Then understand what the respective team wants to achieve for the quarter and see where you can add value. Pick up a side-project in the office or assist the team. Say no to stuff that’s redundant or can be made redundant (maybe via automation or hiring another resource). 

**Pro tip: What is urgent is VERY different from what is truly important. Make exceptions in limited amounts. **

This is macro-level stuff, but then it’s a starting point to understand why you need to start reclaiming your focus. Living life is important too, and work is just a part of life- not life itself. When you truly understand that, you will achieve what people call the impossible- without burning yourself out.
